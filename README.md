    The game uses these key components:

        1. scoring.py handles points and leaderboards

        2. hint_system.py provides intelligent clues

        3. Country data is organized in separate text files

### As we built this, we practiced:

    --> Clean Python architecture
    --> User input validation

# Troubleshooting: 

    If you get stuck:
        --> Make sure all .txt files are in the right folder.
        --> Check you're using an updated Python version.
        --> The game might need permission to update the leaderboard text file.
