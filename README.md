    Test your knowledge of world countries in this interactive Python guessing game! Geoletters is a country-themed  word guessing game. You try to guess the letters of a hidden country name before running out of points or guesses

### How to Play:
    1. Pick a category (African nations, countries with red flags, etc.)

    2. Guess letters to reveal the hidden country name

    3. Use hints carefullyâ€”they'll cost you points!

    4. Try to solve it quickly for bonus points

### Quick Start:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Geoletters.git
    cd Geoletters
    python Geoletters.py

### What Makes This Game Unique:
1. Adaptive scoring system that rewards strategic play
2. Multiple difficulty levels through category selection
3. Persistent leaderboard to track top players

### For Other Developers:
    The game uses these key components:

        1. scoring.py handles points and leaderboards

        2. hint_system.py provides intelligent clues

        3. Country data is organized in separate text files

### As we built this, we practiced:

    --> Clean Python architecture
    --> User input validation

# Interpretation of The Program

### Game Rules

    1. You start with 100 points.
    2. You can ake up to 6 wrong guesses. each wrong letter costs 10 points
    3. You can use a hint at any time by typing 'hint' for 15 points:
        a. First letter
        b. Last letter
        c. Random middle letter
        d. Most repetitive leter in the name
        e. word count and word lengths
    4. The game ends when:
        a. You guess all letters in the country
        b. You run out of points
        c. You reach 6 wrong guesses

### Program Ending & Extra Notes

    1. It shows a congratualaitons message if you won, or a game over message with the correct country name
    2. Input is case-insensitive, but with only sinlge alphabetic characters (ex. A, a, B, b)
    3. If all countries in a category have been sued, the list resets
    4. Countries with characters shorter than 5 or longer than 10 will not be displayed
    

# Troubleshooting: 

    If you get stuck:
        --> Make sure all .txt files are in the right folder.
        --> Check you're using an updated Python version.
        --> The game might need permission to update the leaderboard text file.
