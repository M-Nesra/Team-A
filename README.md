    "Woordle: A Geography Word Challenge"
    Test your knowledge of world countries in this interactive Python guessing game!

How to Play:
    1. Pick a category (African nations, countries with red flags, etc.)

    2. Guess letters to reveal the hidden country name

    3. Use hints carefullyâ€”they'll cost you points!

    4. Try to solve it quickly for bonus points

Quick Start:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Woordle.git
cd Woordle
python Woordle.py

What Makes This Game Unique:
    --> Adaptive scoring system that rewards strategic play

    --> Multiple difficulty levels through category selection

    --> Persistent leaderboard to track top players

For Other Developers:
    The game uses these key components:

        1. scoring.py handles points and leaderboards

        2. hint_system.py provides intelligent clues

        3. Country data is organized in separate text files

Our team built this to practice:

    Clean Python architecture

    User input validation

# Troubleshooting: 

    If you get stuck:
        --> Make sure all .txt files are in the right folder.
        --> Check you're using an updated Python version.
        --> The game might need permission to update the leaderboard text file.
